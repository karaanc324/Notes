### String class is marked as final
### String constant pool. Complier looks if the obj is present in the pool, if yes, provides value to the new reference.
### String str = "Original String"; str = "Changed"; => The value gets changed and the original string is lost as it has no
    reference.
### str.concat("Append"); => str still contains original value, as no reference is provided.
