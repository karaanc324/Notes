## Error:
    The "@angular-devkit/schematics" package cannot be resolved from the workspace root directory. This may be due to an           unsupported node modules structure.
    Please remove both the "node_modules" directory and the package lock file; and then reinstall.
    If this does not correct the problem, please temporarily install the "@angular-devkit/schematics" package within the           workspace. It can be removed once the update is complete
    Soln: npm install @angular-devkit/schematics


## Error: 
  Can not find module “@angular-devkit/build-angular”
  Soln: After creating the project, you need to run
        npm install
